typo somewhere in the middle? Like this

```bash
$ git pull origin master && git chekout -b some-so-long-branch-name && echo "something here.."

From github.com:Koyfin/workshops
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
Already up to date.
git: 'chekout' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.

The most similar command is
	checkout
```

I could propose for you a genius tool for case like this.

### This CLI called.. `thefuck`

Link to repo - https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck

Let's try it.

1. Install cli (I'm preferred use `brew`)
```bash
$ brew install thefuck
```
2. Try it 
``` bash
$ fuck
```
...hmm. It need to write something more for create an alias. But we have other solution

```bash
$ fuck
```
3. Restart your terminal session
4. Let's try again
```bash
$ git pull origin master && git chekout -b some-so-long-branch-name && echo "something here.."

From github.com:Koyfin/workshops
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD

git: 'chekout' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.

$ fuck

git pull origin master && git checkout -b some-so-long-branch-name && echo "something here.." [enter/↑/↓/ctrl+c]

From github.com:Koyfin/workshops
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD

Switched to a new branch 'some-so-long-branch-name'

something here..
```

Additional notes: Unix-like operating systems have a built-in inter-repetition of repeating the last command with the sudo prefix. Just pass `sudo !!`
