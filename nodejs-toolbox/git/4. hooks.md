## Hooks

Every Git repository has a .git/hooks folder with a script for each hook you can bind to.
You're free to change or update these scripts as necessary, and Git will execute them when those events occur.

More details at [documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks)

### Failed pre-commit hook

1. Create `.git/hooks/pre-commit` file at any repository
2. Add to the file:
```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node
console.fatal('\x1b[31m', 'You shall not commit');
process.exit(1);
```
3. Make the file executable:
`chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`
4. Try commit any thing: `commit -am 'Test'`
5. Skip the hook by key `-n`

### Setup husky and lint-staged

Node.js community created for you [husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky).
With this package you can configure hooks at `package.json` similar to `npm scripts`:
```json5
// package.json
{
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "npm test",
      "pre-push": "npm test",
      "...": "..."
    }
  }
}
```

Run unit tests, linter, pretties, type-checking is good place for `pre-commit` hook.
Usually you don't need full repository scan, but only staged files.
[lint-staged](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lint-staged) helps with that:
```json5
// package.json
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.ts": [
      "prettier --write",
      "tslint --fix",
      "git add"
    ]
  },
```

### Self research

- Install and configure husky & lint-staged
- Check what husky do with existing hooks during install
- Google npx and mrm from [The fastest way to start using lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged#installation-and-setup)
